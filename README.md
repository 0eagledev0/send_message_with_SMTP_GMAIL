## Description

This project is a Python application using the Tkinter library to create a graphical interface for sending emails via a Gmail SMTP server. Users can enter their email address, password, recipient's email address, subject, and body of the message. The application then handles sending the email using the provided information.
 
## Features

- **Graphical Interface**: Created with Tkinter, the interface allows users to easily enter the necessary information to send an email.
- **Email Sending via SMTP**: The project uses the `smtplib` module to connect to an SMTP server and send emails.
- **Error Handling**: If an error occurs while sending the email, a dialog box will appear to inform the user.

- Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11
- The following Python libraries:
  - `tkinter` (included by default with Python)
